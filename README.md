# simpleChatbot

This is a simple chatbot using Chatterbot and Chatterbot-corpus.  
The chatbot has been trained with the chatterbot.corpus.english files as well as with some custom yml files.  
It can respond and do a very basic conversation.  
Three features were added:
* providing the definition of a word
* providing the current weather in a city
* providing news about a topic or from a particular country or trending news

For these features to be added the files chatterbot.py and best_match.py from the [main Chatterbot package](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) were tweaked.
